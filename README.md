# Know Your World

## Want to know more about the countries of the world? I've got you!

Have you ever been involved in a conversation with someone and realized geography is not your strong suit? I have, and Know Your World was my solution. 

Know Your World is the ultimate geographical application to help anyone who is lacking in knowledge of the different countries around the world learn about them in minutes!

Not only do users have the ability to study and learn about the countries of the world, they have the ability to save their favorite countries and if, by chance, they’re up for a challenge, there’s a quiz they could take to test their knowledge of how much they learned. 

SQLite Database, Retrofit 2, RecyclerView, Text to speech are among the many libraries utilized in the application.
